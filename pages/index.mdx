# About me

I'm a London based software developer, writing Clojure for <a href="https://farill.io">Farillio</a>.

Previously I spent 5 years working as a programmer at <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>, and before that was a partner at <a href="http://gofreerange.com">Go Free Range</a>,
a collective of talented, like-minded developers.

We built the government part of <a href="https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a>,
replacing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations">all UK ministerial
department websites</a>.

We worked with a small team at the Open University to launch <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a> as a successful online course
provider.

We also worked with other clients including <a href="https://mubi.com/">MUBI</a>, <a href="https://www.o2.co.uk">O2</a> and <a href="https://gofreerange.com/projects">many more</a>.
