`ditto -xk <file> <path>` extracts large zips on OS X (such as those downloaded from Microsoft's set of IE VMs). The standard OS X unzipper corrupts them.

`COPY (<query>) TO <path> DELIMITER ',' CSV;` exports a query from postgres as CSV data.

`psql postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>` lets you connect to a postgresql database using a url

`security find-internet-password -s <server> -w` reads the password for the given server from the OS X keychain.

`who am i --ips|awk '{print $5}'` gets the IP address of your ssh client (from a host you're connected to).

`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <executable>` removes Apple's quarantine, getting past the "... cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified" error.
