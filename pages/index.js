    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
    I'm a London based software developer, writing Clojure for <a href="https://farill.io">Farillio</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Previously I spent 5 years working as a programmer at <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>, and before that was a partner at <a href="http://gofreerange.com">Go Free Range</a>,
    a collective of talented, like-minded developers.
    </p>
    <p>
We built the government part of <a href="https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a>,
replacing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations">all UK ministerial
department websites</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    We worked with a small team at the Open University to launch <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a> as a successful online course
    provider.
    </p>
    <p>
We also worked with other clients including <a href="https://mubi.com/">MUBI</a>, <a href="https://www.o2.co.uk">O2</a> and <a href="https://gofreerange.com/projects">many more</a>.
